## About the Visual Workflow designer

The Visual Workflow Designer provides a powerful drag-and-drop interface that enables you to visually build your workflow processes to achieve better work outcomes. The new intuitive interface adds greater clarity around how you want to map your process steps using statuses, actions and triggers through visual representation like a flowchart and allows you to define your workflow processes with ease.

The new Visual Workflow Designer is fully compatible with workflows from prior Rollbase releases. So, you can continue to manage all your existing workflows as usual and design them in the new Visual Workflow designer.
